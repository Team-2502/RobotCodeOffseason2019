/* TODO This subsystem encompasses the entire carriage and consists of:
        A solenoid which rotates the entire mechanism down towards the ground
        A CIM connected to the cargo intake which is very similar to OBA
        A CIM connected to the hatch intake which spins the compliance wheels in to pickup a hatch and out to place a hatch
        Both motors should not run at the same time
